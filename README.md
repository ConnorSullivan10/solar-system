* Click Functionality:
Whenever you click on an individual planet card, a larger version of that planet card will appear with more details and a description about the planet you selected. Once you decide to move onto another planet, just click the red "X" button in the top right corner of the large Planet card to close it, and go back to the main website where you can view all the planet options again.
