## Description
Use this application to search for and print educational cards detailing each of the planets in our Solar System.

* Hover Functionality:
Hover your mouse over any individual planet name listed on the printed planet cards to reveal an image of that corresponding planet.

* Click Functionality:
Whenever you click on an individual planet card, a larger version of that planet card will appear with more details and a description about the planet you selected. Once you decide to move onto another planet, just click the red "X" button in the top right corner of the large Planet card to close it, and go back to the main website where you can view all the planet options again.

* Search Filter Functionality:
If you'd like to search for a planet based on either it's name or any of the details in it's description, simply type the info you'd like to find in the search bar at the top of the application, and the planet cards listed on the page will be filtered based on what you type in the search bar.
